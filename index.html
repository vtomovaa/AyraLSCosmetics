                <p>
                    LS Cosmetics began as a small business in Malta with a mission to create natural and effective
                    skin
                    care products. Since the launch of our first product, Vitamin C Serum, its consumers have fueled us
                    to
                    continuously improve and re-imagine the skin care routine, inspiring us to develop products that
                    truly
                    make a difference in the skin.
                    <br>
                    As we grew our mission evolved. We believe that everyone deserves access to natural and safe
                    personal
                    care products and we strive to empower our consumers to recognize that they have a choice in their
                    beauty and wellness routines.
                    <br>
                    And while we believe that nature offers the best for safe and effective skin care, we also know that
                    beautiful skin begins with healthy skin. With that in mind, we set out to discover a unique blend of
                    ingredients that was safe for all skin types and supports the skin’s natural barrier. The result was
                    our
                    proprietary strength in botanical complex, a specialized blend of botanical ingredients that support
                    optimal skin health for real beauty results.

                LS Cosmetics Anti-aging Face Cream has a rich, nourishing yet fast-absorbing texture that works to
                reduce signs of aging, skin discoloration, acne scars, to improve texture and firmness and to deeply
                restore the skin from external aggressions making it more resilient and healthier every day.
                Thanks to its premium complex of vitamins and antioxidants, this all-in-one anti-wrinkle cream treats
                fine lines and wrinkles, lack of firmness, uneven tone, age spots, uneven texture, dryness and dullness.
                Additional ingredients including shea butter and phospholipids offer hydration and nutrition for softer,
                smoother and more supple skin.

                The high percentage of Retinol at 2.5% in volume allows to stimulate collagen and elastin production
                while increasing cellular renewal without being harsh on the skin. The effective yet gentle formula
                protects, replenishes and enhances the skin’s natural radiance. With the introduction of this highly
                performing formula in your daily routine, not only will your skin be regenerated but also protected from
                the environmental aggressors we cope with in our everyday life.
                Thanks to its cutting-edge and premium ingredients and the way they are combined you will obtain a
                visibly firmer, plumper and clearer skin.

            <h1> How to apply </h1>
            <p>Apply gently on the face and neck areas with upwards and outwards movements. If you it’s your first time
                using a Retinol based product, start with a three/four times per week application so that your skin can
                gradually adapt to the ingredients while also enjoying the benefits of this wonderful antioxidant.
                Apply an optimal amount of product to cleansed face and neck every night. If this is your first time
                using a retinol-based product, apply the cream 2–4 times a week.

                                    and absorbs well into the skin. After just two weeks of use I can visibly see the

                                    in my skin, especially around the eyes. Friends say I look in my early 60s when I am

                        opted for not mixing Retinol with UV and UVB protection in the same product to avoid any kind of
                        interaction (the combination of products that contain bio active ingredients can alter or
                        neutralize their effects). What we always suggest is to apply sunscreen after the neck
                        moisturizer has been absorbed and to apply in general sunscreen regardless of the cosmetic
                        product that you are using. If you plan to spend a long time exposed to the sun, then it is
                        better to apply the neck moisturizer only at PM.

                        off with a gradual introduction in your skin care so that your skin can adjust to the ingredient
                        while enjoying its extraordinary properties. Once your skin had adjusted to the product, you can

                                I was surprised at how quickly I noticed a difference. It also has a nice green tea
                                aroma. I'll buy it again when I've used it up. I bought the combo with the eye cream to
                                get rid of the dark circles around my eyes and made an immediate difference.

                                It has totally changed my skin, which visibly looks tighter especially the little lines
                                around my eyes. I love putting it on under my make up in the morning for work and every

                            <p>I have tried many products from my dermatologist to the department store counters. Kleem
                                anti aging retinol moisturizer is just the right combination of rigor and gentle for my
                                aging skin. I am 62 and I tried Kleem products without expectations or hope; as is usual
                                for me. I haven't been using the Kleem products long (2 weeks) but I see positive
                                results. My skin is radiant. My wrinkles are less significant. My skin seems thinner.
